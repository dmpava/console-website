Our mission is to provide compassionate, confidential, and empowering counseling services for everyone. We aim to create a nurturing environment where you can explore your thoughts, emotions, and experiences in a safe and supportive space. With compassionate, expert guidance tailored to your individual needs, we will help you build resilience, enhance well-being, and achieve your personal and professional goals with confidence.

### First Session - What to Expect 

The first session focuses on listening to you and building a connection with your inner self. We aim to understand your situation and emotions, the tools you have at your disposal and, delve into your emotional state. During the session, some questions will focus on understanding your support network, exploring past experiences that connect to your current situation, identifying your strengths, and setting your goals. Typically, during this session, you will have the opportunity to speak extensively about what brought you to counseling and, of course, ask questions. A part of the first session will also involve psychoeducation, with the intention of keeping you informed about the appropriate procedures and interventions for you, so you can make an informed decision about how we will structure our work plan.


### Subsequent Sessions 

After jointly creating a work plan, we will continue our sessions with your goals as our milestones. It is important to remember that this is not a race, and we will move at a pace that feels comfortable for you.
