If you are reading this, it is possible that you or someone close to you is looking for a safe place to unload, rest, and renew energy. Counseling is my passion because I have found in this profession a beautiful and useful way to help people.
## Purpose

My purpose is to offer a safe and welcoming environment where diversity and the unique experiences of each individual are recognized and valued. We all face challenges in life, and at some point, we need support to process, plan, and accept our circumstances. Regardless of the size or nature of the challenge, we all need a friendly ear to listen and help us find the inner strength to overcome it.

## Goals

My goal is to be a tool on your path to achieving your goals, helping you become the best version of yourself. With a holistic approach, I focus on your needs and preferences, using evidence-based interventions to achieve the objectives you have set. Some of these interventions include narrative therapy, solution-focused therapy, reminiscence therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy.

In therapy, we grow together, and I deeply value the trust you place in me. I consider it a privilege to accompany you on your journey and to share this path of self-discovery and overcoming. Working together, I firmly believe we can achieve your personal goals and promote your overall well-being.
