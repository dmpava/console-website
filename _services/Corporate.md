# Examples of Our Approach 

We integrate evidence-based therapeutic methods to ensure meaningful and lasting change: 

## Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
Developed by Steven C. Hayes, ACT focuses on psychological flexibility by encouraging individuals to accept their thoughts and feelings rather than fighting against them, while committing to actions that align with their values. 

## Narrative Therapy
Created by Michael White and David Epston, this approach helps individuals reshape their personal narratives, separating problems from identity and fostering new perspectives on their experiences. 

## Reminiscence Therapy
Commonly used in older adults and dementia care, this method helps individuals recall and reflect on past experiences, improving self-esteem and emotional well-being through meaningful memories. 

## Solution-Focused Therapy (SFT)
Developed by Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg, this short-term, goal-oriented therapy emphasizes finding solutions rather than dwelling on problems. It helps individuals identify past successes, strengths, and resources to create a roadmap for future achievements. A core technique includes visualizing a future where their goal has been achieved, reinforcing self-efficacy and motivation. This approach focuses on small, achievable steps that build confidence and momentum toward positive change. Trauma-Informed Practice – A holistic approach that acknowledges the impact of trauma on individuals, ensuring that care is provided in a safe, supportive, and empowering manner.
